This debate is down to another level. All valid points. Snehil: "@Akshay The same applies on Mitchell Starc as well. These players do get injured but the faith put in them pays rich dividends. Don't forget that Starc was the man of the tournament in the 2015 world cup and Shami was India's leading wicket-taker. The only thing is that the workload of such players should be properly managed."

Big appeal , Smith and the bowler decide against the review. This was floated full and was veering into middle and leg, Rahane is hit on the pad as he plays outside the line. Height may have been in question. Angle would've most-certainly taken this down leg.

Cummins comes haring in, the ball slips out of his fingers as he's about to deliver. Slips in his followthrough as well. Has a wry smile. Wouldn't have been smiling had he twisted his ankle

Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, OUT
Stop the press. No double century for Rohit today. Silence accompanies the wicket. This was full and swinging away from off stump, Rohit goes for the drive but this one hits the toe-end of the bat and balloons back to the bowler, who was off balance on his followthrough, but still managed to regain his composure and hold on. Juggling act.

Coulter-Nile to Kohli, no run
Skiddy short ball angling in from outside off, Kohli cops a blow on his left shoulder. Doesn't show any sign of pain. That must hurt though

Alagappan from Eden Gardens: There were dangers of this pitch not having pace with it spending so much time under the covers, with absolutely no sun. But despite that it's playing beautifully. The outfield is super quick too. Rahane's the kind of batsman who thrives when there is pace onto the bat, and then pace off the turf. As those two boundaries showed there is plenty of both.

Alagappan deconstructs the Rohit wicket: Australia have two slips, a point and a cover point but no cover. There's a massive gap to the left of mid-off. Rohit tried to go for it, but he was too early on the shot and was caught and bowled. Kohli tried to go for it, and he gets a thick edge past gully.

Prasanna S: "@ Alagappan - good point but the ball that dismissed Rohit, he would have put it away nine out of 10 times to cover boundary on a deck like this, it wasn't his day. Agree that Kohli tends to play too much away from the body and his off side problems can be exploited."

More analysis from Alagappan: Rahane has only one run on the leg side, off an inside edge when he tried to defend. He takes guard on leg. He is super at driving on the up and cutting the short ones away. And he really has thrived with those shots, the strike-rate right now is nearly run-a-ball. Australia have admittedly bowled off stump and outside to him, and Rahane is happy to play to his strengths, just like Kohli who hasn't minded shuffling across and working them into midwicket and to the right of mid-on.

Stoinis to Kohli, no run
Held up on the surface again, around the good length area. Kohli was through with the drive, lobbed off the top part of the bat, just short of cover

Sloppy work in the infield. Good work by the man at third man though, who was around the ropes to back up the throw from midwicket. Kohli dabbed it there and scampered a run, only to get a few more.

The heat seems to have taken its toll on Kohli as he stretched fully to complete that run. His shirt is soaking with sweat.

Head to Rahane, 1 run, OUT
Driven nicely off the frontfoot towards deep cover. Rahane was slow to turn for second and that may have cost him a split-second. He was ambling through the second when he realised the throw was coming to his end. Wade collected the throw cleanly and whipped the bails off to catch Rahane short despite a full-length dive. Credit to Hilton Cartwright as well for the super-flat throw. India lose one against the run of play

Ajinkya Rahane run out (Cartwright/†Wade) 55 (110m 64b 7x4 0x6) SR: 85.93
Here's Manish Pandey at his IPL home ground.

Al with stuff from the ice-cool Eden press box: Substitutes racing down every over to tend to both teams' players. Wade had two men tending to him last over, Cummins had one placing an ice-pack on his neck (no idea how he's still bowling 147 kph). India's two batsmen were given running repairs as well. Umpires are close-by to make sure they don't take too much time out of the game. Rahane put his hand up, as if to suggest he didn't want the second, but had to run anyway as he saw Kohli come through.

Agar to Pandey, OUT
Goes through. Pandey has struggled against pace this series. That's not a good shot. Hurried for pace again, goes back and looks to cut a straight ball. There is a hint of turn too. Both his feet are in the air as he missed the cut. A nothing shot, an awful shot. The ball clips the top of off. Put himself under pressure with so many dot balls, when he felt he needed a scoring shot, he needed to play it off a good ball

Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, OUT
And gone. Jadhav tries to get underneath and cut again but it was too full for that. He may have been better off trying to play that down, instead he brought his bat from down to up, which means the ball will only go up. The full length means there isn't enough elevation and Maxwell, at backward point, gobbles it up.

Kedar Jadhav c Maxwell b Coulter-Nile 24 (36m 24b 2x4 1x6) SR: 100
Don't think the Eden Gardens crowd was disappointed with that dismissal. Dhoni is in, the crowd goes wild.

He has pulled that, and he has absolutely nailed it. Short down leg, not high enough. Unlike Jadhav, Dhoni brings his bat from up to down, keeping it all along the ground. Finds the gap at backward square leg with nonchalant ease.

Kane Richardson to Hardik, (no ball)
A high full toss outside off, Pandya skews his heave but can only find Smith at cover. Smith wants the run-out too, he throws the ball back to the bowler and Richardson takes off the bails with Pandya nowhere in sight. Looks like it is over waist, and that should be a no-ball. It is. There is a free hit, but no cricket as the players run off. Chaos. Smith has a chat with the umpires about it. Australia definitely completed the run-out as Pandya started walking off. Smith arguing that the ball was not dead. Did the umpires signal out? They did not call it a no-ball on the field because the third umpire decided that.

Skm: "If this is considered as a dead ball, will it be still a no ball ?" Both.

Meanwhile, here's Manoj: "Why the bowlers have to bat? The game is already tilted in favor of batsmen. Flat pitch, small boundary. If they can't score runs on thier own, they don't deserve a place. They don't bowl. "

Ganesh: "Law 27.7 Batsman leaving his wicket under a misapprehension An umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batsman, not having been given out, has left his wicket under a misapprehension that he is out. The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by the fielding side and shall recall the batsman." That clears things up.

5.13pm The umpires are lingering about. The players have walked off. Looks like a thin drizzle presently. Alagappan Muthu, from the ground, says just the square and the ground is covered. The weather seems to be clearing up, but our confusion regarding the run-out/dead ball is not. We'll keep you updated.

5.20pm The covers are coming off. We're not far away from a resumption. "Ropes are being dragged across the outfield to send away the moisture," says Al Muthu

Oh yes. Wade will feel a lot better now, mentally at least. Full and wide outside off, Kuldeep wafts with his weight firmly on the back foot. Gets a thick outside edge that flies towards Wade, who wanted to go with both hands, but improvised midway through knowing that he can't get there. So he stuck out his left hand, behind his back and hung on. One of the better catches you'll see

W
Kane Richardson to Hardik, OUT
Smashed! But straight down to long-off. A slower full toss outside off, and intentionally bowled that wide outside off. Pandya hits it decently but not well enough. Finds Warner

Kane Richardson to Chahal, 1 run
Another slow full toss on off, dabbed to cover for one. Bat on ball, par for the course now

49.3
0
Kane Richardson to Bumrah, no run
Another slower ball outside off, Bumrah's big swing travels only as far as the bowler

49.4

Kane Richardson to Bumrah, FOUR runs
Another boundary. Bumrah's cameo lifts India past 250. Another slower ball outside off, the heave trickles into the boundary at square leg. The fielder was up.

Kane Richardson to Bumrah, 1 run
A legcutter outside off, far and wide, dabbed to backward point for a run.

49.6
W
Kane Richardson to Chahal, OUT
Run-out! And India are all out. A short and wide slower ball that is very wide outside off, Chahal can't connect, he runs down before Bumrah sends him back. Wade runs up and hits the stumps directly.

Yuzvendra Chahal run out (†Wade) 1 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50
Ajinkya Rahane: We were looking to get 260-270, but 250 is decent. I knew if I take my time, I could play my shots. We wanted to disrupt their plans. We were looking to get 290, in between was not easy to rotate the strike, wicket was two paced. Really challenging conditions.

5.43pm This isn't exactly what India would have wanted, a score of 252. But this is not a batting surface, it's slow and two-paced. Australia will definitely take that, especially when Kohli and Rahane were going so well. But Kohli's wicket, after a typically fluent 92, slowed down India to the point where all they could aim for was close to 270. They fell short of that too. Australia, despite their batting struggles, will fancy their chances in this game. Shashank will be back with you in a bit for the first half of the chase.
